# CRUD app to post workouts for
Ever been sick of normal ways to log workouts. Good thing you came over this! This has been designed to log and design workouts for.

#Story time
I have orginally done a fairly similar app to this one. Link to it [here](https://github.com/jrh1010101101010/project2) but i was unsatisified by it. It was orignally done in short space of time while i was using express and has fairly simple relationships between data that has ended up not creating a good product. So I choose to remake it using new tools. React native and its authetication processes and supabase. I had orignally written up a backend to get a feel for how it would work, ([link](https://github.com/jrh1010101101010/pyt_workout)). It gave a nice visuallisation to the project before working with the project completely.

# The process
As time went on it felt more obvious to me how much more i wanted to do with and how much more I time i would sink into this if time went on. However, i do plan on making better use of what i have already done and adding more features as time goes on.
